\chapter{Manual Objective}
	This manual is intended for the end user of the Radio Collar Tracker system.  It is written with the expectation that the end user has some experience flying \glspl{multirotor} in semi-autonomous or autonomous modes.  This manual should not be regarded as standalone training manual for flight operations, rather, it should part of hands-on training on how to operate this system safely.  This manual contains procedures on how to safely operate this system, as well as information on how to maintain and repair the system.
\chapter{System Overview}
	\section{Mission Profile}
		This system is designed to conduct aerial surveys for the purpose of tracking and localizing wildlife collars used for biological and ecological research.  We approach this problem by flying a radio across the search area, recording the signal strength for any pings from any collars we can detect.  We can then determine the location of a collar by correlating the signal strength and the locations where we detected that particular signal strength.

		\subsection{Phases of Flight}
			The overall flight can be broken up into multiple phases of flight: pre-takeoff, takeoff, climb, survey, approach, landing, and post-landing.

			The pre-takeoff phase of flight involves configuring and setting up the system for the intended survey.  This includes completing all relevant checks, flight planning, and maintenance.

			The takeoff phase of flight involves getting the system into the air in a safe and controlled manner.  This includes the initial climb to clear any obstacles in the takeoff zone.  This may be conducted manually or via automated mission command.

			The climb phase of flight involves getting the system to the survey objective area.  This may be conducted manually or via automated mission command.

			The survey phase of flight is the largest chunk of the flight time, and is usually conducted under complete autopilot control.  This is the phase of flight where the system is actively looking for collars.

			The approach phase of flight involves getting the system from survey altitude to the landing altitude.  This may be conducted manually or via automated mission command.

			The landing phase of flight involves getting the system out of the air and on the ground in a safe and controlled manner.  This includes the final descent to clear any obstacles in the landing zone.  This may be conducted manually or via automated mission command.

			The post-landing phase of flight involves securing the system, and safely shutting down all equipment.

			Many, if not all, of these phases of flight may be programmed as part of the automated mission.  This system can be automated to the point where the autopilot is responsible for takeoff, climb, survey, approach, and landing.
	\section{Aircraft}
		\subsection{Aircraft Summary}
			The airframe used in this \gls{UAS} is a 3DR Solo, which is a \gls{COTS} \gls{quadcopter}.  We have then added an independent payload that does not interface with the aircraft control system.
		\subsection{Aircraft Specifications}
			See Section 11.1 in the 3DR Solo User Manual.
		\subsection{Transmitter Layout}
			See Sections 1.3 and 5.6 in the 3DR Solo User Manual.
		\subsection{Aircraft Layout}
			See Section 1.2 in the 3DR Solo User Manual
	\section{Payload}
		\subsection{Payload Summary}
			The payload for this \gls{UAS} is a computerized radio recorder.  We have elected to use a software defined radio as our radio front end, as this allows us to rapidly reconfigure the payload for any range of frequencies.  This is connected to an Intel Joule, which handles all of the data collection, including collecting position data from the autopilot system.  Recorded data is organized into runs, which are stored on an SD card.
		\subsection{Payload Specifications}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Computer\hfill Intel Joule
				\item Radio \hfill USRP B200-mini(-i)
				\item Weight \hfill 125 g
			\end{itemize}
	\section{Ground Control System}
		The \gls{GCS} for this \gls{UAS} consists of a laptop running a Windows OS and the open source flight management software, MissionPlanner.  This connects to the aircraft over the SoloLink WiFi network, permitting 2-way digital communications between the \gls{UAS} and the \gls{GCS}.  From the \gls{GCS}, we are able to plan, upload, and control all missions, as well as provide the pilot with flight and diagnostic information.
		
		See \autoref{chap:FMS}.
	\section{Crew Roles}
		\subsection{Pilot In Command}
			The \gls{PIC} is responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft.  He or she is responsible for takeoff, transition to survey, return, and landing, as well as for the general pacing of the mission.
		\subsection{Autopilot Operator}
			The \gls{AO} is responsible for monitoring the flight management software and survey progress.  He or she must plan and upload the mission plan to the aircraft, confirm clearance for switching to autonomous flight modes, and monitor the \gls{UAS} as it completes the mission.  The \gls{PIC} may also take on these duties so long as doing so does not jeopardize the safety of bystanders or the aircraft.
		\subsection{Visual Observer}
			The \gls{VO} is responsible for spotting the aircraft as it flies near flight operations area boundaries.  The \gls{VO} should have some form of communications link to the PIC, and should notify the PIC if the \gls{UAS} violates any area boundaries or comes near an obstacle.  Additionally, the \gls{VO} is responsible for recovering a downed \gls{UAS} to avoid disruption of any other activities in the area, and to maintain safety within the flight operations area boundaries.

			Having a \gls{VO} does not relieve the \gls{PIC} of the responsibility of maintaining \gls{LOS} to the \gls{UAS}.
\chapter{Checklists and Flight Procedures}
	The \gls{PIC} must use the below checklists and procedures when operating the system to ensure safe and proper operation of the system.  Failure to complete all items in either checklists or procedures may result in system misconfiguration or system failure.  The \gls{PIC} is responsible for the operation of the aircraft in accordance with all relevant rules and procedures, except that the \gls{PIC} may deviate from these rules where such deviation is necessary in the interests of safety.

\chapter{Emergency Procedures}
	\section{Battery Fire on Ground}
		Battery fires are caused by extreme physical or electrical damage to the battery pack.  Battery fires may be preceded by significant warming and/or puffing of the battery pack.
		\begin{mdframed}[linecolor=red,linewidth=4pt]
			WARNING: \gls{LiPo} fires are chemical fires, and can release dangerous chemicals.  ABC fire extinguishers are NOT effective against the primary battery fire, but may prevent the fire from spreading.  If available, use a CO2, dry chemical, or foam extinguisher to contain the primary fire.  Do not use water to extinguish the primary fire, however, water may be used to cool a battery and fight secondary fires as appropriate.
		\end{mdframed}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item If the battery has not caught fire yet, but is extremely warm, immediately unplug it from any devices and take the battery outside.  Place it away from flammable items and in a well ventilated area. Allow the battery to sit for at least 30 minutes.  If the battery has cooled down in 30 minutes, it will likely not catch fire, however, the battery must be disposed of properly.  If the battery is still hot, allow it to remain outside until it has cooled off.
			\item If the battery catches fire while connected to a charger, disconnect the charger from the wall, and, if safe to do so, carry the entire charging setup outside, away from flammable items and place in a well ventilated area. If not safe to do so, remove flammable items from the area and fight any secondary fires.  Do not fight the battery fire itself, as it is self-oxidizing.

			Even if the primary fire is out, if the pack is warm, additional cells may catch fire due to thermal loading.  The battery pack is not safe until the entire pack is cooled to room temperature.
			\item If the battery catches fire while connected to the aircraft, if safe to do so, remove the battery from the aircraft.  If unable to remove the battery, if safe to do so, flip the aircraft so that the battery is on top of the aircraft to reduce damage to the aircraft.  Carry the batteries and any attached items outside, away from flammable items and place in a well ventilated area.  If not safe to move the batteries, remove flammable items from the area and fight any secondary fires.  Do not fight the primary battery fire itself, as it is self-oxidizing.

			Even if the primary fire is out, if the pack is warm, additional cells may catch fire due to thermal loading.  The battery pack is not safe until the entire pack is cooled to room temperature.
		\end{enumerate}
	\section{Loss of Autopilot Datalink}
		If the autopilot operator reports loss of link to the \gls{UAS} (characterized by no data packets received for about 5 seconds), then the \gls{UAS} will automatically initiate an \gls{RTL}.  This will continue even if the aircraft datalink is recovered.  To recover, set the flight mode to LOITER.
\chapter{Maintenance}
	This section contains checklists and procedures to facilitate the maintenance and repair of the \gls{UAS}.  The \gls{UAS} must pass all items within the Delivery Check before being placed into service.  Failure of any one of these checks may result in system failure.
	\section{Charging Batteries}
		See Section 2.3.1 in the 3DR Solo User Manual.
	\section{Propellers}
		\subsection{Inspection}
		Nylon propellers should be replaced if they are damaged.  Visually inspect the propeller for abnormal tears or warping.

		\subsection{Removal}
		To remove the propeller, unscrew the propeller from the motor housing.  Silver-top propellers unscrew counterclockwise; black-top propellers unscrew clockwise.  Check the unlock icons on each propeller to see the correct directions for removing.

		\subsection{Installation}
		To install the propeller, screw the propeller onto the motor housing.  Silver-top propellers tighten clockwise; black-top propellers tighten counterclockwise.  Check the lock icons on each propeller to see the correct directions for tightening.
	
	\section{Payload Antenna}
		\subsection{Inspection}
			Ensure that the antenna is not bent or warped in any way.

		\subsection{Removal}
		To remove the payload antenna, first disconnect the payload antenna from the payload by unscrewing the SMA connector on the antenna.  Next, remove the antenna by removing the velcro straps holding the antenna to the copter.

		\subsection{Installation}
		To install the payload antenna, attach the antenna to the copter's left side using the provided velcro straps.  Ensure that the antenna is nestled in the corner made by the copter's arms and landing gear.  Next, connect the SMA connectors on the antenna and the payload.
	\section{Payload Hardware}
		\subsection{Inspection}

		\subsection{Removal}
		To remove the payload, first disconnect the payload power, autopilot telemetry cable, and payload antenna from the payload.  Next, remove the two screws holding the payload to the aircraft.

		\subsection{Installation}
		To install the payload, align the payload with the existing screw holes on the aircraft so that the user interface devices face the outside of the aircraft.  Install the two screws to secure the payload to the aircraft.  Connect the payload power, autopilot telemetry cable, and payload antenna to the payload.

			\centering
			\caption{Mission Planner Flight Data Screen}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{mp_hud_full.jpg}
			\label{fig:mp_flt_data}
		\end{figure}
		The primary responsibility of the \gls{AO} is to monitor the \gls{UAS} as it progresses through its programmed mission using the Flight Data Screen (\autoref{fig:mp_flt_data}).  During this time, the autopilot operator should be monitoring the vital signs from the \gls{UAS}, including ground speed, mission progress, altitude, attitude, stability, battery voltage, battery consumption, power draw, and navigation stability, among other things.  In most cases, monitoring the artificial horizon and flight map will suffice - check that the \gls{UAS} is tracking properly to the waypoints, and that the aircraft has a reasonable attitude for its current speed and heading.  In addition, the \gls{AO} can use the wireless telemetry connection readout as a gauge of the quality of the autopilot datalink.  Occasionally, check the battery voltage and consumption to ensure that the \gls{UAS} has enough power to complete the mission and return.
	\section{Connecting GCS MAVLINK}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Select UDP.  See \autoref{fig:MP_Connect}.
				\begin{figure}[ht]

	\section{Checking on the Payload Status}
		The payload has four possible states: 
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{||c c||}
			\hline
			State & Meaning\\ [0.5ex]
			\hline\hline
			Not Connected & At least one of the components of the payload is not ready to record. \\
			\hline
			Idle & All components of the payload are ready. \\
			\hline
			Running & The payload is recording. \\
			\hline
			Stopping & The payload is in the process of ending the recording. \\
			\hline
			Failed & At least one of the components of the payload has failed. \\ [1ex]
			\hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		To check on the status of the payload:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item With the GCS open and connected to the payload, locate the series of drop-downs in the right-most column of the user interface.
			\item Expand the drop-down labeled "Components".
			\item The entry next to "Status" is the current status of the payload.
			\item If additional information about the status of individual components within the payload is desired, refer to the following subsection.
		\end{enumerate}
		\subsection{Checking the Status of Individual Components Within Payload}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item With the GCS open and connected to the payload, locate the series of drop-downs in the right-most column of the user interface.
				\item Expand the drop-down labeled "Components".
				\item Now expand the drop-down labeled "Component Statuses".
				\item Five individual component statuses will be displayed here.
